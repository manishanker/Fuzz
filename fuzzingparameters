Fuzzing {image_id}
image id is a collection of numbers from 0-9 , a,b,c,d,e,f
1.image-id format is 8-4-4-8. ow to fuzz these inputs we can have all the combinations of 16^32
2.Above method is giving the fuzz data directly to the input.
3. Next case would be to have a templeate.since glance only accepts the image ids that are already created in image resource.
4. Template can have the combinations of valid imageid's. It can have the combinations of different image ids or same image id repeated multiple times
5. should include timeout b/w each api fuzz call
6. Since tags can be anything, fuzz payload from the user can be directly given where ever tag is expected
